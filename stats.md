# Statstics calculation

The statistics is prety straightforward: user selects time 
period and set of categories and app shows ammounts sums 
for each spending that happened in given period for all 
categories. There should be some kind of indication if some
categories overlap. 

Possible feature: allow user to save sets of categories to
allow quick access to stats by different dimensions
